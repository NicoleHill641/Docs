# Introduction to C# on the BrainPad 
It is not a secret that C and C++ are the most popular programming languages among professionals. This is particularly true for programmers that work with small digital systems.

C# (pronounced see-sharp) and a modern cousin of the C and C++ family. Its syntax is very close to Java, another very popular programming language.

## Overview
Students will learn programming logic while creating projects in Visual Studio. Applications in this lesson will be limited to the `BrainPad` object, `If` statements, a `While` loop and the template methods.

## Install Visual Studio and TinyCLR OS extension
Skip this step if you have Visual Studio 2017 and the TinyCLR OS extension installed:

[Setting Up Visual Studio for the BrainPad](../setup_visual_studio.md)

## Guidelines 
* Prerequisites: None
* Ages 6 and up
* PC setup with Visual Studio 2017 and TinyCLR OS extension installed. [Click Here](../setup_visual_studio.md)
* Supplies: BrainPad and microUSB cable.

## Starting a New C# BrainPad Project
Next Open Visual Studio select `File > New > Project` and under Other Languages select `Visual C# > TinyCLR` and choose the `BrainPad Application`. Change the Location to  `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Desktop\` then name the project `BrainPad_Project`.


From Visual Studio, select File > New > Project:

![Start New Visual C# Project](images/introduction/start_new_visual_csharp_project.jpg) 

Once created, you will be presented with a `Program.cs` tab.

![Program Contents Shown](images/introduction/program_contents_shown.jpg)  

This file contains the default code when you first create a project. The lines in green that begin with ``//`` are called comments, and they generally describe what the code does. Take a moment to review them. You can create your own comments in the code by typing ``//`` before any notes you would like to add. Comments do not affect how your program runs. 

Comments are a great place to keep notes about how a piece of code might work. They are helpful if another programmer looks at your code, or if you return to look at your own code at a later date, to help you understand what the code is doing behind the scenes. 

Let's run the code to see these comments' descriptions come to life. Connect the BrainPad and press the `F5` function key or the Start button in Visual Studio's toolbar.

![F5 Key and Start Button](images/introduction/start_key_button.jpg)

Visual Studio will now run the code, a few things will happen and the display will now have the text `"Hello!"`.

![Using IntellSense LightBulb](images/introduction/display_hello.jpg)

## The BrainPad Object
The world around us is full of objects. Every person, table or circuit board is an object. If we were to ask a person to say "hello," we would be asking an object to perform a task. The same concept can be applied to code, specifically object-oriented programming. For example, in the previous application we ran, the BrainPad was asked to control the `Display` through the `BrainPad` object.

The `BrainPad` object itself is a piece of code that is contained in one file. This was developed by GHI Electronics to cover the internals of the BrainPad. This enables students, like you, an easy way to control the BrainPad circuit board.

After typing `BrainPad`, press the period key to get a list of all available options for this object, like LightBulb. As shown in the image below.

![Using IntelliSense](images/introduction/using_intellisense.jpg)

Now we can use the arrow keys to go up and down in the list to find the LightBulb, and then press the period key again to see what options are the available for the LightBulb.

![Using IntelliSense with the LightBulb](images/introduction/using_intellsense_lightbulb.jpg)

Visual Studio does a great deal of simplifying the programming process by automatically listing available options for an object. They call this neat option built into Visual Studio, _IntelliSense_
Now that we know how to use the `BrainPad` object, let's learn about controlling the `LightBulb`.

## The BrainPad LightBulb
LED lights are used in many different electronic devices. Here we will test the *LightBulb* by turning it green, then on, then off. 
Copy and paste the code from the example below into your project's `BrainPadSetup()`, between its two curly braces ``{ }``. You'll also notice every line of code **must** ends with a semicolon `;`

> [!Tip]
> Parentheses `( )` and curly braces `{ }` are used differently in C# programming, do not confuse them.


```
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
```
Now, press `F5` on the keyboard or the `Start` button in Visual Studio to run the code and you will see the *LightBulb* turn green, come on, and stay on. 

This happens because our code is executed faster than we can see. So we never see the *LightBulb* actually blink.

## Problem Solving
Since applications execute extremely fast, we need to slow them down to figure out the problem. This way we can see what is happening or if the results are as expected. We will start by running the code one line at a time, this is called stepping in code to see what the application does at a slow speed.

## Stepping in Code
With Visual Studio we can "step" through the code executing each line separately, one at a time. 
This will help when you are trying to debug a problem. To do this, we need to add what is called a **breakpoint** or stop point.

A breakpoint is a spot in your program where the code will execute until it reaches the breakpoint, then Visual Studio will wait for further instructions. 
 
To add a breakpoint at the first line of code inside of `BrainPadSetup()`, move the cursor to that line and press the `F9` key, as shown below. A red circle will appear to the left of your code. This is where your code will stop and wait. 

You can also click in the grey area where the breakpoints appear to either remove or create new breakpoints. Your program can have as many breakpoints as you feel necessary to diagnose any programming issues. 

![Adding a Breakpoint](images/introduction/adding_breakpoint.jpg)

Press `F5` key or `Start` button in Visual Studio to run the application. The project will be built and deployed, but, then the execution will stop at the breakpoint, as shown below.

![Stopping at the Breakpoint](images/introduction/stop_breakpoint.jpg)

Once a program reaches a breakpoint, it pauses the program, right where it is in the code,
as noted by the yellow arrow now in the red circle. You have several options to continue or step through you code line by line, while the program is still running. 

If you press the `Continue` button in the top tool bar of Visual Studio as shown below. Your program will continue, to the end of the code or the next breakpoint.

  ![Stopping at the Breakpoint](images/introduction/continue_button.jpg) 

To the right of the `Continue` button are more buttons for navigating the code while the program is running. Unlike the `Continue` button, the `Step Into` button or `F11` key advances your program one line of code at a time. This can be very useful when trying to diagnose programming errors.

  ![Stepping into code](images/introduction/stepping_into.jpg) 



## Adding Delays to Code
In order to see what is going on, we need to add some delays in the program code. This is done by telling the BrainPad to `Wait` between tasks.
Copy and paste the code from below into your project's `BrainPadSetup()`, between the two curly braces `{ }`. 

```
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
```
Run the code by pressing `F5` key or `Start` button in Visual Studo and observe the LightBulb again. You should now see it turn green, then on, and off twice.

## Change the LightBulb Color
This works great if you only want the LightBulb green. But what if you want a different color?   The LED inside the LightBulb is capable of showing more colors than just green. Think of an LED TV, and how thousands of LEDs are lined up in rows and columns to make the picture you see. Each LED must be able to show the color needed to make the image and then change color quickly to change the image as needed.  First we will use code similar to the last example, only this time, we will change the LightBulb from green to red to blue, using built-in methods already created.  
Copy and paste the code from below into your project's `BrainPadSetup()`, between the two curly braces `{ }`. 

```
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed();
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnBlue();
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
```

## Even more LightBulb Colors.
Under the `BrainPad.LightBulb object` you will find the method, `BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor()`.   The `TurnColor(r,g,b)` method takes three arguments which describe the color of the light bulb. The first argument tells the light bulb how much red to use, the second how much green, and the third how much blue. Each number is a percentage, or a number from 0 to 100 with 0 being off and 100 being full brightness.
```
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(100, 100, 100);
```
We will now redo the code above that turns the light from Green to Red to Blue. But this time we'll use the `TurnColor()` method to achieve the exact same results. 

Copy and paste the code from below into your project's `BrainPadSetup()`, between the two curly braces `{ }`. 

```
BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(45, 0, "Red");
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(1, 0, 0);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);

BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(35, 8, "Green");
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 2, 0);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);

BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(40, 16, "Blue");
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 0, 5);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);

BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(29, 24, "Yellow");
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(10, 10, 0);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);

BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(41, 32, "Cyan");
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 20, 20);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);

BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(25, 40, "Magenta");
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(50, 0, 50);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);

BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(37, 48, "White");
BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(100, 100, 100);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);
```

## BrainPad Buzzer
Included on your BrainPad is a **Buzzer**. You can use this Buzzer to program different sounds you would like to use in your program.  Like the `BrainPad.LightBulb` object, you will also have to tell the `Buzzer` object to `Beep`, `StartBuzzing` and `StopBuzzing`, as well as tell the BrainPad to `Wait` in between playing and not playing sound. When you tell the BrainPad to `Wait` after you tell it to `StartBuzzing`, the sound will play for that duration. If you tell it to `Wait` after you tell it to `StopBuzzing`, it will stay silent for that duration.

Copy and paste the following code into your `BrainPadSetUp()` between the curly braces `{}`. Press `F5` key or `Start` button in Visual Studio.
```
 BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(100);
 BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
 BrainPad.Buzzer.StopBuzzing();
```
You should hear a very low tone, that plays for one(1) second and stops. 

Inside the `BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(100)` method you will see that in the code we have added the value of 100. This is the frequency of the sound that will be played by the Buzzer. You can change this value to create a bunch of different sounds. Let's try changing it.

Copy and paste the following code into your `BrainPadSetUp()` between the curly braces `{}`. Press `F5` on the keyboard or `Start` on the Visual Studio toolbar.
```
BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(400);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
BrainPad.Buzzer.StartBuzzing(100);
BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1);
BrainPad.Buzzer.StopBuzzing();
```
First you will hear the Buzzer make a very high sound, then a very low sound. This is what changing the frequency does to the Buzzer. 

Try changing the frequency to different values and see what kind of sounds the Buzzer makes. 

## BrainPad Buttons
![Buttons on the BrainPad](images/introduction/buttons_.jpg)

The BrainPad comes with four buttons (Up, Down, Left & Right) that can be programmed to do different things. For example, you can program it so when a button is pressed, the LightBulb turns on, or maybe, the Buzzer makes a sound.  

To accomplish this we need to use what is called an "if statement".

An "if statement" will check and see if our buttons are being pressed, and then execute a piece of code when they are. 

## If Statement
```
if (condition) {
   Execute this code;
}
else {
   Execute this code;
}
 ```
An if statement (or conditional statement) checks to see whether a statement is true or false, and then does one of two things, depending on the result. The example above shows the framework of the if statement. 

You will also notice that the if statement is one of the few lines of code that **DOES NOT** require a semicolon `;` at the end of the line, although the code within the if statement still requires an ending semicolon `;`

Now we will use the same structure in our code to detect the LEFT button being pressed. 
```
public void BrainPadSetup() {

     BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();

     if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) {
         BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
     }
}

public void BrainPadLoop() {   
}
```
For the above code to work properly, you have to be holding the button down at the time the program starts. This is because the code within the `BrainPadSetup()` method only executes once. When the program is first started. Holding down the Left button when the program starts is impractical and not very useful to a program. We need to be able to press & read the button anytime the program is running. To do this, we will move the button checking "if statement" inside the `BrainPadLoop()` method instead of the `BrainPadSetup()`
```
public void BrainPadSetup() {
      BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
}
         
public void BrainPadLoop() {
     if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) {
         BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
     }
}
```
The above code first makes sure the Light Bulb is OFF and then it falls into an infinite loop, called the `BrainpadLoop()`. However, this program still has an operational bug. Run the program and test it. The green light will be off when the program runs and then once the LEFT button is pressed the green light will turn on. That is all good so far, but when the button is released, the green light stays on. Can you guess why? Try stepping in the code to see what happens when the button is pressed and when it is not pressed.

Computers are strict at following orders. In the previous examples, the Light Bulb never turned off because we actually never told the program to turn the green light off. This means we have to tell the program to turn the light on when the button is pressed and we also have to tell it to turn the light off when the button is not pressed

```
public void BrainPadSetup() {
    BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
}
         
public void BrainPadLoop() {
    if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) {
        BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
    }

    if (!BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) {
        BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
    }
}
```
The `!` symbol represents the opposite. While the BrainPad does not have a method called `BrainPad.Button.IsLeftNotPressed()` we can continue to use `BrainPad.Button.IsLeftPressed()` but with a `!` before it, to represent if the button is not pressed.  Now when you run it, not pressing the button will turn/keep the *LightBulb* off.

## Logical Operators -- Or & And -- || and &&
![Keyboard Location ](images/introduction/or_and_keys.jpg)

The **Or** operator is found by holding the shift key and pressing the `||` key  twice, the **And** operator can be found by holding the shift key and pressing `&&` twice

These are typically used within the **if statement**. Let's assume in our previous example you wanted to press the *Left* button to make the *LightBulb* Green and when you press the *Right* button you want to make the *LightBulb* Red. If neither button is pressed the *LightBulb* is off. 
To accomplish this you will need to use the **And** operator `&&` to check and make sure both buttons are **Not** (!) pressed, and turn off the *LightBulb*. 
In the code example below, in our third **if statement**, you can see where we ask the question, "Is the *Right* button pressed **And** is the *Left* button pressed?" 
Both of these condition must be met in order to execute the code in its curly braces`{ }`. When using the **Or** operator `||`, only one of the conditions need to be met to run the code within the curly braces `{}`. 
```
public void BrainPadSetup() {
    BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
}
         
public void BrainPadLoop() {
    if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) {
        BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
    }

    if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsRightPressed()) {
        BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed();
    }

    if (!BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed() && !BrainPad.Buttons.IsRightPressed()) {
        BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
    }
}
```

## The Else Statement
The **else statement** is always used with the **if statement** and has a very useful purpose that would be perfect for the last example. In the previous code example, we needed to check if the *Left* button was being pressed or not. We can simplify this by including an **else** statement after the **if statement** when the **if statement** is not true, as shown in the code below

```
public void BrainPadSetup() {
    BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
}
         
public void BrainPadLoop() {
    if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) {
     BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); // If TRUE    
    }

    else {
      BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); // Else FALSE

    }
}
```

## The Else-If Statement
The **else-if statement** closely resembles the **else statement** but works like both an **if statement** and an **else statement** together. Unlike the **else statement** by itself, the **else-if statement** checks to make sure its condition is true before executing the code inside its curly braces `{}` rather then just executing it by default. 

Below is an example of the similar code as used earlier, but using an "else-if statement" instead.
```
public void BrainPadSetup() {
     BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
}

public void BrainPadLoop() {
    if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsLeftPressed()) {
        BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen();
    }

    else if (BrainPad.Buttons.IsRightPressed()) {
             BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed();
    }
    else {
        BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff();
    }
}
```

## Whitespace
Spaces and lines are used to make our code more readable to humans. C# programs completely ignore **whitespace** as shown in the code example below. It will execute correctly, but without whitespace it can be very difficult to read and debug. 
``` 
public void BrainPadSetup(){BrainPad.TrafficLight.TurnGreenLightOff();}public void BrainPadLoop(){if (BrainPad.Button.IsUpPressed() && BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed()){BrainPad.Buzzer.PlayFrequency(5000);}else{BrainPad.Buzzer.Stop();}} 
```
