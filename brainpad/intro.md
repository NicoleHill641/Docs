# BrainPad Intro
![BrainPad](../hardware/products/images/brainpad.jpg) 

The BrainPad is a revolutionary board for STEM and STEAM programs. It was designed to be used by both beginners and advanced programmers. The simple design makes it easy for beginners to understand how electronics process information and make things we can see, hear, and feel happen. The expandability port challenges the advanced user to increase their knowledge by connecting and programming periphels to make more complex electronics.

This video shows a 6-year-old using a PC for the first time! And her first PC experience was in programming the BrainPad.

The BrainPad design is based on the TinYCLR OS's official FEZ hardware. This means that the BrainPad will always receive the latest TinyCLR OS updates.

# The Future Plan
 After years of working with hundreds of students, the BrainPad setup has been designed and changed to make it as simple and user-friendly as possible and uses the TinyCLR OS ecosystem of boards. However, we want your feedback as we are constantly working on improving the BrainPad to make it even better.

This video shows one of the schools we worked with:

# The Community
We have been working with local and online communities for years. Hop on our [forum](https://forums.ghielectronics.com/c/brainpad) and share the discussion now. Or [talk to us directly](http://brainpad.com/contact-us/) about our next local community gathering. Teachers and students, like you, are also interested in STEM & STEAM.

# Firmware Update

## Using TinyCLR Config
(coming soon)

## Manual Loading the Firmware
TinyCLR Config tool should be used to update the firmware. As a backup, use the instructions on the [bootloader page](../hardware/loaders/ghi_bootloader.md) for manual update.

Here is a video that shows the manual firmware update. It also includes the steps needed for the old BrainPad and steps for updating the bootloader.

 The BrainPad uses the [FEZCLR firmware](../tinyclr/downloads.md#fezclr)

# Advance Hardware Info
Advance hardware info are found on the [hardware](../hardware/products/brainpad.md) page. Also, learn about the magic [TinyCLR OS](../tinyclr/intro.md). 

# The Original BrainPad
![BrainPad](../hardware/products/images/original-brainpad.jpg) 
The Original (old) BrainPad (the large one) has been decommissioned. It has served well in working with schools to help us make a lot of decisions. 

> [!Tip]
> You can determine if you have the old BrainPad by looking for the traffic light on the top right corner. Only the old BrainPad has the traffic light.

As a bonus, we will continue to support the original BrainPad with the new software. However, emulating the old display with the new software is severely effecting the system's performance. The display will not be enabled by default. We do not recommend the use of display on the old BrainPad.

## Using the Traffic Light
The new software does not include the traffic light as the new BrainPad doesn't have a traffic light. However, this can be added as shown in this video.
